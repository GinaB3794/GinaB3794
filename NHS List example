Let's create an example of a complex NHS table in SQL that includes a list of patient data, incidents with medication, and solutions. I'll first provide the SQL code to create the tables and insert sample data, then I'll explain the process as if I were presenting it in a meeting.
Step 1: Create the SQL Tables
Here's the SQL code to create the necessary tables and insert sample data:

-- Create Patients table
CREATE TABLE Patients (
    PatientID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Postcode VARCHAR(10),
    Phone VARCHAR(15),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create Medications table
CREATE TABLE Medications (
    MedicationID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    MedicationName VARCHAR(100),
    Dosage VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Incidents table
CREATE TABLE Incidents (
    IncidentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    PatientID INT,
    MedicationID INT,
    IncidentDate DATE,
    IncidentDescription TEXT,
    Solution TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (PatientID) REFERENCES Patients(PatientID),
    FOREIGN KEY (MedicationID) REFERENCES Medications(MedicationID)
);

-- Insert sample data into Patients table
INSERT INTO Patients (PatientID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Gender, Address, City, Postcode, Phone, Email)
VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Smith', '1980-05-15', 'Male', '123 Main St', 'London', 'SW1A 1AA', '0123456789', 'john@example.com'),
(2, 'Alice', 'Johnson', '1975-10-20', 'Female', '456 Elm St', 'Manchester', 'M1 1AA', '0234567891', 'alice@example.com'),
(3, 'Michael', 'Brown', '1990-03-05', 'Male', '789 Oak St', 'Birmingham', 'B1 1AA', '0345678912', 'michael@example.com');

-- Insert sample data into Medications table
INSERT INTO Medications (MedicationID, MedicationName, Dosage)
VALUES
(1, 'Aspirin', '100mg'),
(2, 'Amoxicillin', '500mg'),
(3, 'Insulin', '10 units');

-- Insert sample data into Incidents table
INSERT INTO Incidents (IncidentID, PatientID, MedicationID, IncidentDate, IncidentDescription, Solution)
VALUES
(1, 1, 1, '2022-03-15', 'Overdose of Aspirin', 'Administered activated charcoal and monitored vitals'),
(2, 2, 2, '2022-04-10', 'Allergic reaction to Amoxicillin', 'Administered epinephrine and antihistamines'),
(3, 3, 3, '2022-05-20', 'Incorrect Insulin dosage', 'Adjusted dosage and provided patient education'),
(4, 1, 3, '2022-06-15', 'Missed Insulin dose', 'Provided additional dose and education on the importance of adherence');

Step 2: Presenting the Process
This analysis is crucial for improving patient safety and the overall quality of care

1.To start with, we structured our data into three main tables: Patients, Medications, and Incidents:

Patients Table: This table stores essential information about our patients including their ID, name, date of birth, gender, address, city, postcode, phone number, and email.

Medications Table: This table includes details about the medications prescribed to patients, including the medication ID, name, and dosage.

Incidents Table: This is the core of our analysis, capturing incidents related to medication administration. It links to both the Patients and Medications tables via foreign keys. The table records the incident ID, patient ID, medication ID, date of the incident, a description of the incident, and the solution implemented.

2.Inserting Sample Data:

To illustrate the functionality, we populated the tables with sample data:

Three patients with basic information.
Three medications with their respective dosages.
Four incidents detailing the problems encountered with medication and the solutions provided."
SQL Data Insertion Example:

Here is an example of the data insertion process:

-- Insert sample data into Patients table
INSERT INTO Patients (PatientID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Gender, Address, City, Postcode, Phone, Email)
VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Smith', '1980-05-15', 'Male', '123 Main St', 'London', 'SW1A 1AA', '0123456789', 'john@example.com');

-- Insert sample data into Medications table
INSERT INTO Medications (MedicationID, MedicationName, Dosage)
VALUES
(1, 'Aspirin', '100mg');

-- Insert sample data into Incidents table
INSERT INTO Incidents (IncidentID, PatientID, MedicationID, IncidentDate, IncidentDescription, Solution)
VALUES
(1, 1, 1, '2022-03-15', 'Overdose of Aspirin', 'Administered activated charcoal and monitored vitals');

Analysis and Findings:

With this data structure, we were able to analyze incidents effectively. For example, we identified that patient John Smith had two incidents related to medication errors with Aspirin and Insulin. By examining these incidents, we provided timely solutions such as administering activated charcoal for overdose and adjusting the insulin dosage.

Our findings highlighted key areas for improvement:

Enhanced patient education on medication adherence.
Regular review and monitoring of medication dosages.
Quick response protocols for allergic reactions and overdoses.
By implementing these solutions, we aim to reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related incidents, ultimately improving patient safety and care quality.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this structured approach to tracking and analyzing medication incidents provides us with valuable insights into patient care. By continually refining our processes and focusing on patient education, we can mitigate risks and enhance the overall effectiveness of our treatments.

Thank you for your attention. I am open to any questions or further discussions on how we can improve our data analysis and patient care strategies.
